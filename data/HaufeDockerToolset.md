# Haufe Docker-Toolset

There are already many useful tools around **Docker** and it is hard to define what will be the best option in the future.

For the time being, using Docker at **Haufe** asks for sticking to the "roots", so we don't waste time and effort in short-lived hypes or workarounds that do more harm than good.

The somewhat reduced "official" toolset consists of

  * [Docker Engine](DockerEngine.md)
  * [Docker Compose](DockerCompose.md)
  * [Docker Machine (Docker Swarm)](DockerMachine.md)
